Personal Website, don't think of stealing code retard.


For anyone that cares,
I've made this repository to act as a host for my website,
I'm trying to re-master my skills in HTML, JS and CSS after a while of not using them.

I plan to make updates in batches,
the most time consuming thing is securing my website from new vulnerabilities because there's always gonna be ONE retard that's gonna root my shit.
